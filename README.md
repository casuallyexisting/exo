# Exo

*The jankiest project you ever did see*

Exo is a framework for training an AGI chatbot. It implements many different neural nets, including voice synthesis, video synthesis, and (obviously) text generation.

## Installation

Not currently available.

## Usage
*Still working on making everything user-friendly*

- Connect to socket at address 127.0.0.1 on port 25077
```python
socket.sendall(b'userid://message')
data = sock.recv(16384)
print(data)
>>> 'response'
```
userid is used to enable holding a conversation with multiple people, while remembering the context of the conversation.
